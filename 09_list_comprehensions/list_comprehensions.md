### List comprehensions

*List comprehensions* are a syntax feature of python with which many loops can
be rewritten in a more declarative functional style. Code that makes use of
list-comprehensions is often shorter, less indented, communicates its intent
more concisely, and is therefore more readable than its imperative
counterpart.

For example, consider the following function that takes a list of numbers and
computes a list with their squares:

```python
squares = []
for n in numbers:
    squares.append(n ** 2)
```

Whenever you see a `for`-loop like that in python code, you should be thinking
*"Can I write this more succinctly using a list comprehension?"*

The same can be written as follows with list comprehensions:

```python
squares = [n ** 2 for n in numbers]
```

List comprehensions can also include `if` conditions that allow filtering
out certain items. For example consider the following code that filters all
even numbers from a list of arbitrary numbers:

```python
even = []
for n in numbers:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        even.append(n)
```

Again, the same can be written using a list comprehensions:

```python
even = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
```

This syntax also supports more complex constructs such as nested loops. For
example, the following flattens a document that is given as a list of lines,
where each line is in turn represented by a list of words:

```python
flattened = []
for line in text:
    for word in line:
        flattened.append(word)
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
flattened = [
    word
    for line in text
    for word in line
]
```


#### Related constructs

There are three closely related syntaxes in python that work the same way but
result in different data types.

- *dict* comprehensions: `{k: v for ...}`
- *set* comprehensions: `{x for ...}`
- *generator* expressions: `(x for ...)`
